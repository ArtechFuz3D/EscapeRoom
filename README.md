# FART HELL ESCAPE ROOM üí®

Welcome to **FART HELL**, a cursed, glitchy, and utterly infuriating web-based escape room that‚Äôll make you question your life choices. Hosted at [artechfuz3d.github.io/EscapeRoom](https://artechfuz3d.github.io/EscapeRoom/), this game is a three-level nightmare where every mouse move farts, popups mock you, and the Fart God laughs at your suffering.

## About the Game

FART HELL is a deliberately broken HTML escape room with three levels of chaos:

- **Level 1: Fart Nightmare** (`index.html`, Code: 6969)
- **Level 2: Fart Prison** (`level01.html`, Code: 6666)
- **Level 3: Fart Hell** (`level02.html`, Code: 5555)

Each level challenges you to enter a 4-digit code to "escape" (spoiler: you never really escape). Expect:

- Fart sounds on *every* mouse event (click, move, hover, you name it).
- Glitchy animations, broken CSS, and seizure-inducing GIF backgrounds.
- Trolling clues, fake hints, and error popups that spin and taunt.
- A meta layer in Level 3 with lies hidden in the source code and console.

Winning a level loads the next one. Beat Level 3? You‚Äôre dumped back to Level 1 with a mocking ‚ÄúFART GOD MOCKS YOU!‚Äù Good luck, loser.

## How to Play

1. Visit [artechfuz3d.github.io/EscapeRoom](https://artechfuz3d.github.io/EscapeRoom/).
2. Enter the 4-digit code for each level (hint: they‚Äôre hidden in plain sight or buried in the chaos).
3. Endure the farts, popups, and glitches. Try not to rage-quit.
4. Pro tip: Check the source code or console in Level 3 for meta-trolling hints (or more lies).

## Installation (for Local Play)

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/artechfuz3d/EscapeRoom.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a browser. No server needed‚Äîthis is pure HTML/JS/CSS garbage.
3. Ensure you have fart sound files (e.g., `fart-01.mp3`, `fart-02.mp3`, `fart-03.mp3`) in the right directory or replace placeholder URLs (`https://www.soundjay.com/human/fart-0X.mp3`) with local files.

## Features

- **Fart Sounds Galore**: Three fart sounds (more in Level 3) triggered by every mouse event. Audio may require interaction due to browser restrictions.
- **Broken Aesthetics**: Comic Sans, Papyrus, Arial Black, clashing colors, and GIF backgrounds that hurt your eyes.
- **Annoying Mechanics**: Randomly moving clues, disabled inputs, fake buttons, and error popups that say ‚ÄúFART GOD WATCHES.‚Äù
- **Level Progression**: Beat a level to load the next. Level 3 loops back to Level 1 for eternal suffering.
- **Meta Trolling**: Level 3 hides the real code (5555) in faint clues and source comments, while fake codes (0000, 1234, 7777, 9999) taunt you.

## Known Issues

- Fart sounds may not play until user interaction (browser policy). Click something to unleash the farts.
- Placeholder sound URLs from SoundJay may not work. Replace with local `.mp3` files.
- Performance may lag on slow devices due to excessive animations and popups. That‚Äôs the point.
- No favicon yet. Want a poop emoji icon? Make one at [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/).

## Contributing

This is a trash fire by design, but if you want to add more farts, glitches, or trolling, submit a pull request. Ideas:

- More fart sounds (check [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/) for 170+ free farts).
- New levels with even dumber mechanics.
- A ‚Äúleaderboard‚Äù that just insults players.
